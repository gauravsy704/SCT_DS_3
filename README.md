# SCT_DS_3
SCT_DATASCIENCE_Task3, data source and outputs.

## Task Overview
Built a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service, based on demographic and behavioral data using the Bank Marketing dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Achieved strong test accuracy and visualized model results using Python and key data science libraries.

## Tools Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- GitHub for version control

## Key Findings
- Data was clean, with no missing or duplicate values.
- Label encoding enabled the use of categorical features.
- Model accuracy reached up to 91%; test accuracy was up to 89-90.5%.
- The decision tree highlighted important customer features and visualized them effectively.

## Files
- bank-additional.csv: Bank Marketing dataset from UCI ML Repository
- SCT_DS_3.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with code and results
- SCT_DS_3.pdf: Visualizations (graphs, plots) included in the notebook

## Methodology
1. Imported and inspected dataset.
2. Checked and cleaned data: handled categorical columns via label encoding.
3. Explored data: generated histograms and boxplots for key variables.
4. Split data for training and testing.
5. Built and evaluated decision tree classifier (Scikit-learn), computed confusion matrix and accuracy.
6. Visualized features, decision tree, and results.
